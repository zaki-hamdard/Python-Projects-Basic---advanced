# Tip Calculator App

This Python program calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including the tip.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts you to enter the total bill amount.
2. It asks for the tip percentage you want to add (10%, 12%, or 15%).
3. It asks how many people the bill will be split between.
4. It calculates and displays the amount each person should pay.
