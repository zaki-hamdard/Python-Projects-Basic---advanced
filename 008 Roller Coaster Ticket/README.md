# Roller Coaster Ticket Calculator

Welcome to the Roller Coaster Ticket Calculator! This Python script calculates the ticket price for a roller coaster ride based on the user's height, age, and optional photo purchase.

## How It Works

1. The script greets the user with a welcome message.
2. It prompts the user to input their name and height.
3. It checks if the user meets the minimum height requirement (120 cm) to ride the roller coaster.
4. If the user meets the height requirement:
    - It asks for the user's age and determines the ticket price based on the age:
        - $12 for ages over 18
        - $7 for ages between 12 and 18
        - $5 for ages under 12
    - It asks if the user wants a photo, which adds $3 to the total bill if selected.
5. It announces whether the user can ride and the total bill amount.
6. If the user does not meet the height requirement, it informs the user that they cannot ride.
