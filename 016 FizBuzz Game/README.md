# FizzBuzz Game

Welcome to the FizzBuzz Game! This classic programming challenge outputs numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, it prints "Buzz." For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz." This application is great for teaching basic programming concepts and conditionals.
