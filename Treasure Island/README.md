# Treasure Island Game

Welcome to the Treasure Island! This interactive text-based adventure game challenges players to make the right choices to find the treasure.

## How It Works

The game presents a series of choices to the player. Depending on the player's decisions, they will either move closer to finding the treasure or face a "Game Over" message. The objective is to find the correct path to win the game.

## Game Flow

1. The player starts at a crossroad and must choose to go "left" or "right".
2. If the player chooses "right", the game ends with a "Game Over" message.
3. If the player chooses "left", they must then choose to either "swim" or "wait for a boat".
4. If the player chooses "swim", the game ends with a "Game Over" message.
5. If the player chooses to wait for a boat, they must then choose between entering a "red", "blue", or "yellow" door.
6. Choosing the "yellow" door leads to a victory message, while choosing any other door ends the game with a "Game Over" message.
