# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors game! This simple Python application allows you to play the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

## Game Description

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a traditional hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible shapes are "Rock" (a fist), "Paper" (an open hand), and "Scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). This application simulates this game in a text-based format where you can play against the computer.

## How It Works

- The game starts by prompting the player to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors by entering 0, 1, or 2 respectively.
- The computer randomly selects its choice.
- The game then compares the player's choice with the computer's choice according to the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors:
  - Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins)
  - Scissors cut Paper (Scissors win)
  - Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)
- The game displays the choices and announces the winner or if the game is a draw.

## Rules

1. **Rock (0)** beats Scissors (2).
2. **Scissors (2)** beat Paper (1).
